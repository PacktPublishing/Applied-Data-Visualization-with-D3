# Applied Data Visualization with D3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Applied Data Visualization with D3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/applied-data-visualization-d3-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789341119), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course has a real-world, case-study approach, where you will be given data sets from different domains. These data sets will have different visualization goal. Each video focuses on a particular task at hand, and is explained in a very simple, easy to understand manner. We also learn how to receive information through WebSockets and visualizing them in different ways. Another interesting topic covered in  this course is Voronoi based visualizations and approach and ways to create heatmaps. Towards the end of the course, we go deeper into the tools provided by D3.js to create custom shapes and paths.
